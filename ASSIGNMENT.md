# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned to use the module simply through a lot of testing. Granted, jumping into it was the hardest part. However, once I had my test.js up and running, understanding the module components only took time. Aspects of the module like the README and the npm documentation also gave a good overview. The module gave way to readability in two manners: 1) including test scripts and data, and 2) having very simple and to the point naming conventions. 
> While the test data provided wasn't entirely expansive of the module, it gave a good start to understanding it. Using the data provided, I was able to understand the basic inputs and outputs of the module, along with certain constraints like allowed characters and .ini conventions.
> Impressively simplistic naming conventions of variables and method names also allowed for greater readability. I was able to follow along in reading the code due to objects and aspects of the code using short and consistent names. 
> One huge change that would've made this a lot easier would've been reading everything and starting from the bottom first. I kind of just jumped in when I saw the biggest function (encode) and had to do a few logical jumps to understand the library. Making an almost mental UML of the module structure and starting from the most basic method/object would've been a smarter move. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Simply put, I think that raising the level of abstraction in comments means that the comments should inform the reader of the purpose of the code. Or in other terms, raising abstraction should give way to why you need the code, rather than what the code does. 
> If I had to explain to a new programmer on how to write an effective comment , I would tell them: "Write comments as if the code below will change." If they do the opposite of this, then changing some code will result in having to change the comment as well.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Around 4.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> No.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Finding a module was a bit difficult, so I went with one of the suggested ones. Maybe a way to understand the npm search better?
